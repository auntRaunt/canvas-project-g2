/*

How background-color works, for when we have to write things up.

Set background color using the color palette.

Click background-color-set to set the color.

The color is set only for whatever is behind the present shapes on the canvas.

Therefore, if a background color has previously been set, a new one cannot be set without first clearing the entire page.

We might want to put this in a seperate js file.
